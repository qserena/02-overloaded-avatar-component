# Avatar Component

## Description
An app where you can write your own notes and format the texts with markup tags. If you click the Preview button at the top you will see the markup appearance!

In this version the notes are stored in a database which means they are visible for everyone. I have another version which stores to localstorage.

## Patch that had to be done
Because of the dependency from react-mde to react 17 I had to do some stuff from [this stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73077186/react-mde-cant-install-on-react-18-2-0)
